5.5		(07/21/2022)
     * CRITICAL logic repair to 'blanks' suppression support during INLINE hilite!
     * Alternate coding fix to vague (Mac observed) race-condition bug w/combobox mis-creation.
     * Added status display of merge choice counts presently targetted as pure Left or Right
     * Popup menu disables "Edit" (file) when POP occurs over DiffMap (not a L/R window).
       -    BUT is now active over most window elements having a Left/Right connotation.
       -    'Find Nearest' selected above DiffMap evaluates choice at SCALED chosen position.
     * Codified preference 'upgrade' detection, yeilding safer 'new version' transitions.
     * Internal: Preference evolution of older settings now tied to explicit versioning data 
     * Created "Engine config" Prefs tab:
       - permits access to other Diff engines having alternate algorithms.
       - Codifies what is needed/expected FROM the underlying engine and HOW it is accessed.
       - Still permits ad-hoc flag specs AND cmdline pass-thru.
       -    former 'diffcmd' Pref now DERIVED from engine settings (for reference purposes)
       -    former 'ignoreblanks' Pref (on/off) generalized to refer to ALL engine suppressions
       -    primary engine options (suppressions) now specifically delineated AND configurable
       -    shares options among Diff and DiffSrch when same command (1st word), else distinct
     * Added warning HILITE to Preference actions that result in FORCING a new Diff invocation.
     * Internal: general support for "Unified" Diff outputs, facilitating wider Engine acceptance
     * Internal: Dbg messaging permits suspended arg-EVAL until KNOWN they are used (less overhead).
     * Handful of spelling typos, internal naming and code consolidations, as always: updated Help.

5.4		(04/01/2022):
     * Visual Inline-diff SUPPRESSION categories (correlatable to those of Diff) supported
       yet specific choices are INDEPENDANT of said same Diff MATCH suppressions
     * Optional support for MULTIPLE Preference files w/command-line specification added
       permits user configuration for disjoint projects w/alternate SCM requirements
     * Reengineered optional SyncScroll to no longer permit fractured alignment - FOREVER
       only specific features may TEMPORARILY override the Preference when set.
     * New preference allows specifying filename patterns to EXCLUDE from searches among
       directories when forming candidate pairings for examination.
     * Text searching now (optionally) scrolls EITHER/BOTH windows independent of the current
       overall synchronized window preference setting. Allows visual alignment between the
       displayed file content based on individual text searches per each window.
     * Within Vpath SCM context, CWD location now effectively TOP-prunes stated VPATH 
       nodes allowing access to yet older V-nodes w/o editting VPATH 
     * Subdirs WITHIN given Vpath nodes now recognized as legitimate CWD-scoped locations
       permitting operations on directory-based subdivisions while STILL Vpath'd
     * Repaired how Vpath searches for Topmost and/or Prior version for consistent results
     * MouseWheel now scrolls properly when above checkbuttons WITHIN the filelist Dialog

5.3		(12/24/2021):

     * Silenced new recurrence of "TCL-sensitive" characters faulting within input filenames
     * Filelist dialog now immediately responds fully to a threshold change
     * Added missing Wheel scrolling to filelist dialog
     * Ensure "Class" of secondary window(s) REMAIN designated as "Tkdiff"; not "Toplevel"
     * Tkt#82 - usage of the Perforce SCM was crashing (wrong var reference)

5.2.1		(03/27/2021):
     * New user preference affects how multiple-files are presented to the user.
       Choice of menu display has been capped at a variable maximum of 1-25. Now
       uses a separate dialog window when file count exceeds current max setting.
     * Sidestepped Tcl bug affecting "recursive diff" results when default user
       pref "-q" option is removed. Will now correctly suppress "binary" files.
     * Repaired toolbar confusion at startup about using Icon or Text buttons

5.2		(03/04/2021):
     * Permits entire directory TREEs to be scanned for candidate files recursively
     * Now stipples the BOUNDARY LINE during "Split"-push manipulations: clearer feedback
     * Reduce 'interactive startup' reliance on a message console and promote a "retry" paradigm
     * Fixed broken "Find Nearest Diff" (via the popup menu) to use initial popup LOCATION
     * Repaired Windows derivation of the INITIAL temp-dir path preference for NEW users.
     * Resolved minor clipping issue in toolbar combobox (re: proportional fonts)

     * Visible Focus-tabbing restored to dir/file browser buttons in NewDiff dialog

5.1             (11/11/2020):
     * Now supports user customization of keyboard function bindings
     - new 4th preferences Tab allows review, editting and saving of such bindings
     * Failure-modes for user involved input is now more forgiving (w/feedback)
     - applies to preference modifications and/or inconsistent run-modes.
     * Scrollable bookmarks: allows access when more exist than can fit on screen.
     - bookmark menu w/report 'participation' checkbutton (and annotation access item)
     - bookmark annotation: user specified identities - beyond the default hunk index
     * New report fmt - based on individualized bookmark establishment for content
     * Increased report STATISTICS info, plus a means to view it without needing a report
     * More robust (internal) 'Read-Only' text display re-implementation
     - restores damaged Keyboard scrolling and hotkey usage in addition to GUI traversals
     * Redesigned internal implementation to restore MacOS network-latency reporting support
     * Dropped Monochrome support (revivable, but rather pointless)
     * Incorrect mainwindow MANUAL-resizing logic repaired (improper "gridding")
     * Tkt#73 - repaired typo causing crash of "conflict" file processing
     * Tkt#74 - scrolling w/autoselect ON crashed when scrolled prior to the 1st hunk min-bound
     *        + autoselect now operates passively (autocenter NOT triggered)
     * Tkt#75 - syntactic repair resolves crash of COMBINED merge choice (L+R or R+L) usage
     * Addressed bug displaying a combobox w/multiple monitors, and a NON-virtual window-manager
     * Fixed (yet again) un-raised Tooltip windows on Mac (will NOT happen again)
     * Repaired crash caused by situational ancestral-data corner condition in 3-way Diff
     * Relaxed popup-position management on 2nd+ usage - now re-appears at most recent location
     * Minor fix prevents wrong subwins from squeezing shut during a manual resizing to smaller
     * Repair unintended session-long ASYNc behavior due to incomplete removal of the trigger
     * Ensure Text window focus-highlighting remains visible when Text FG/BG is altered
     * Removal of several (5+) internal excess-work situations improving responsiveness
     * Online help updated to cover aspects of ALL changes (incl. removed restrictions)


5.0             (06/08/2020):
     * NewDiff Dialog can now request a Conflict file comparison
     - It also permits adjustment of SCM choice or search-mode
     - and is now ALWAYS defaulted when no args are given, except
     - in one specific preference-controlled situation (autoSrch).
     * Merging when using an Ancestor file now identifies inconsistent
     - "deletions" similar to additions, among the two versions merging
     - and factors into the automatic merge choice determinations
     * CVS is now able to produce a list of candidate comparisons
     * ALL SCMs doing candidate detection now handle CONFLICTed files
     * URLs (Svn style) accepted as FileSpec by Dialog and Cmdline

     -    dblClick "find Nearest hunk" binding when within meta-info window
     -    scrollwheel now works when within Merge meta-info window
     -    Lnum/CBar highlighting no longer fails during hunk-suppresssion
     -    Diffmap draws properly when Diffed text lacked newlines
     -    setting an -I "regex" on the cmdline also activates them,
     -    filenames with "sensitive" characters ($ []) wont crash
     -    Missing/wrong text highlighting on random count of last hunk(s)
     -    Default Filebrowser preferred-view-content filters mis-specified
     - Online help updated/expanded to cover aspects of ALL changes


4.3.5           (08/08/2018):

4.3.4           (07/21/2018):
     * Emergency Re-repair of the (V4.3.3) Merge content corruption issue
     - previous fix targeted a phantom cause (only fixed SOME cases)

4.3.3           (07/19/2018):
     * Critical bug that MIGHT corrupt Merge content via Split use fixed
     * Re-implementation of 3way Diff support now functions properly
     - merge choices are preset via 3way analysis AHEAD of user preference

     * better tolerance of Windows filenames
     * CDE, Windows, and MacOSX aware

      for cases where diff decided to treat whitespace slightly different
      on missing-EOL files when doing 3-way diffs.

      'accurev diff foo.c'
    * Fixes as a result of running Scriptics' error
      checker (see archives for details)
    * 'q' is quit

3.03m changes:

    * Added -o <output file> to set the name of the merge

    * slight modification for how change bars are colored
    * bug fix for up/down arrow keys (they were moving by

      individual characters are highlighted in that window
    * added "<file> vs. <file>" to the window title 
      (eg: foo-old.txt vs. foo.txt - TkDiff 3.03) -- this 
      more closely aligns with Windows standards, and is
      equally useful on other platforms, I suppose
    * online help has been updated to reflect these changes

        + As of 3.00: (11/06/1998)
                A new GUI.
                No more reliance on perl...  It's 100% Tcl/Tk now.
                Built-in editor.
                A "find" facility.
                Lots more...  And all of this thanks to Bryan Oakley!

        + GPL'ed (as of 2.03).

        + RCS, CVS and SCCS support (auto-detected)...  Even more SCM
          systems are supported in 3.00.

        + Highlighted difference regions, randomly accessible, with a
          quick overview/navigation bar.

        + Side-by-side viewing and linked (synchronized) scrolling of files.

        + On-line help and extensive customization (also much-improved in
          3.00).

        + File-merge and change-summary facilities.

        + Line-number toggling (for easier cut & paste), with extra goodies
          as of 3.00.

        + Windows NT support.

...and more stuff I can't even remember, probably.

Much work has been done by Bryan Oakley for this release (in fact, 99%
of it). :-)  Thanks, Bryan!  Keep an eye on the tkdiff home page at
http://www.ipass.net/~klassa/tkdiff for developments...  I don't think
there'll be many, at this point -- Bryan has turned this thing into just
about all you could ask for!  If you have problems, though, please send
bug reports (better yet, patches :-)) against 3.00 to klassa@ipass.net.
